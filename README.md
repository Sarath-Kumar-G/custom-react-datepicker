Welcome to our `<CustomDatePicker/>` component, an innovative solution crafted using the `react-datepicker` library and styled elegantly with `Tailwind CSS 3`. This component is a direct outcome of the challenges we faced while integrating various date-picking functionalities into web projects. It's tailored to streamline the date selection process, especially for booking flows, and has been refined through insights and inputs from expert developer.
